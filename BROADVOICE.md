# 350 million user leak in Broadvoice scandal

- What kind of attack was this?

This kind of cyber attack could technically be an SQL injection type attack. It could have
also be classified as a simple attack by logging into the database and running custom SQL
commands without the website or applications provided front end client or fraudulent
authorization.

- How was this vulnerability discovered & how was it exploited?

The discovery of this leak was made by Bob Diachenko, a security consultant. The configuration
files for the database had not been set, or made in error, causing easy access to all of the
companies information and requiring no authorization on accessing any information queries.

- What security measures could have been used to prevent this?

Setting up and testing database access, as well as using insights on suspicious activity
on the database could have detected and ended this attack sooner than it was. Even if
information was leaked, having access to logs of what users and authorization is accessing
what information can show trends in suspicious access and queries.



Concluding this, the leak was eventually plugged and the database configurations were
successfully handled. It is unsure as to what information was leaked to an attacker, if any,
but it could have been easily upwards of 350 million users. This could be used by attackers
later to invade privacy, used in identity theft and fraud, or stored for later in future
phising attempted with targeted information to the users.
